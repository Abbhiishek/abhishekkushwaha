# About Me

#### Most of the things you (maybe) want to know about me

My name is Abhishek Kushwaha. I study Computer Science and Engineering at JIS University Kolkata, West Bengal, India. My hobbies include building software, reading, and teaching how to code.

I am interested in building communities because I believe that communities are the backbone of society. They help in bringing people together, sharing knowledge, and helping each other grow. I have been a part of various communities and have seen the impact they have on people's lives. I want to build an inclusive community where people could share ideas and receive help.

I started my software development journey with discord bots for fun, later found my passion in building web apps. I was fascinated by the idea of building something that could interact with people. I wrote my first line of code back in [school](https://www.khalsaschoolkolkata.org/) when i was in class 10. I love to code in JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. Currently learning Rust.

Apart from coding, I love to bing watch sci-fi movies and tv shows. I am a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Star Wars franchise. I also love to read books, my favorite genres are science fiction and fantasy. I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

I hold a passion to play cricket but never got a chance to playðŸ˜­. Talking about playing, I love pc games. I have been playing games since I was a kid. My first pc game was [Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2012 video game) ](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted_(2012_video_game)>). Currently playing [A Plague Tale: Innocence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Plague_Tale:_Innocence)

In my free time, I love to document my learning and write blogs. In past, I have written blogs on [dev.to](https://dev.to/abbhiishek) and [hashnode](https://h.abhishekkushwaha.me/). I have also wrote some [python blogs for scaler academy](https://www.scaler.com/topics/author/abhishek-kushwaha/).

I am always open to new opportunities and challenges. If you have any ideas or projects you want to collaborate on, feel free to reach out to me. I am always looking for new ways to learn and grow.
